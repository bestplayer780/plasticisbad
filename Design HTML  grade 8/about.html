<h1 class="bag-title-4">About us</h1>
<p class="aboutus">Welcome to my project, where our passion for sustainability and creativity intersects to create a positive impact on the world.</p>
<P class="aboutus">Our journey started with a simple but profound idea: to combat waste, reduce environmental footprints, and embrace conscious living. We achieve this by upcycling discarded clothing into unique, eco-friendly cloth bags.</P>
<p class="aboutus">Our mission is clear - we aim to contribute to a greener planet by diverting textiles from landfills while offering you exquisite, one-of-a-kind bags that are fashionable and environmentally responsible. </p>
<p class="aboutus">Each bag is a work of art with its own story, meticulously crafted for both style and durability. When you choose us, you're supporting a cause, joining the global sustainability movement.</p>
<p class="aboutus">Small actions can drive significant change. Get involved by supporting us, making a purchase, or donating your old clothes to help us create more wonderful bags.</p>
<p class="aboutus">Thank you for vsiting this website and do note this is for a school project only and we are not physically selling bags.</p>
